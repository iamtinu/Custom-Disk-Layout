# Custom-Disk-Layout
I am creating this repository to make useful Custom Disk Layouts available for you to use when performing OS installation automation via pxe boot.
I use these in Tenant-OS Regularly you can use it anywhere you like.

If you want a custom disk layout, I can make them on request.

Hope You Like these. Thank You
